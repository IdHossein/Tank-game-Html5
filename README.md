- **High Score** — Personal best saved automatically via `localStorage`

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls

| Action | Key(s) |
|---|---|
| Move Left | `←` Arrow Left &nbsp;/&nbsp; `A` |
| Move Right | `→` Arrow Right &nbsp;/&nbsp; `D` |
| Fire | `Space` |

### Gameplay Tips
- 🛡️ **Don't let enemies cross the red line** — that ends the game instantly.
- 🎯 **Prioritize Bosses** — they have high HP and reach the line quickly.
- 🚁 **Watch out for Helicopters** — they oscillate horizontally, making them harder to hit.
- ⬆️ **Level up fast** — upgrades unlock at levels 3, 5, and 7, significantly boosting your firepower.
- 🔥 **Keep moving** — staying still makes you an easy target for incoming fire.
